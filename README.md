A modern, free reader built with Electron

GABO is a desktop application designed to read e-books in a comfortable, fast, and organized way.
I decided to develop this app because I couldn’t find a free, modern, and well-designed desktop reader that matched exactly what I wanted… so I decided to build my own.

My goal with GABO is to create a lightweight, visually appealing, and fully customizable reading experience for people who enjoy reading on their computer.
